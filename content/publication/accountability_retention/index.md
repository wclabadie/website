abstract: 	In this paper, I explore the effect of public school accountability rules on school-level grade retention policy. In particular, I study the impact of accountability criteria that are based on year-to-year changes in student test scores. I develop a simple framework to simulate an administrator's retention strategy decision under a test score level-based accountability system and under a system that evaluates schools based on both levels and changes. The baseline framework predicts that in order to maximize the school-wide average test score, an administrator must retain almost all failing students; to maximize both the school-wide average level and the school-wide average increase in scores, an administrator must promote more aggressively in later grades. Students promoted from the last grade of a school are removed from the pool of test-takers, and the framework consistently predicts low retention in the final grade offered by a school after test score changes are added to the accountability system. Using a novel dataset of school-grade level retention rates for 7 states in the U.S. and an event study design, I find that about 30\% fewer students are retained on average each year when a state adds student growth to the accountability criteria by which schools are evaluated. This number roughly corresponds to around 360,000 fewer retained students each year nationwide, and \$4.2 billion saved in public school expenditures. I further find that administrators do retain significantly fewer students in the last grade offered by their schools. My results suggest that school administrators are willing to use retention as a tool for optimizing their schools' accountability ratings, and that the components of accountability systems do alter administrator behaviors.
